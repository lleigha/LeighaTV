The inaugural issue of the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://newcityreader.org/issue01.html">New City Reader</a></em>, an iterant newspaper produced on-site at the New Museum during <em><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/1080">The Last Newspaper</a></em> show in 2010, is a graphic depiction of the July 1977 blackout in New York City. Specifically, it chronicles the improvised production of the next morningâ€™s New York Times, using printed media as  a lens through which to view responses to infrastructural collapse. This is a project of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkarchitecturelab.org/">Network Architecture Lab</a>.
