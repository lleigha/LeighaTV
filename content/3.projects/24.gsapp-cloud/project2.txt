The End of Year Show occurs annually and exhibits the research and design work produced by students at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. This microsite documented the 2013 exhibition as it was designed and built live from 9 webcams located throughout the spaces of Avery Hall. It captured the enormous transformation of the school over a short period of time, and surveyed how the work was viewed and experienced. This is a project of the Architecture Online Lab produced with <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/troytherrien">Troy Conrad Therrien</a>.
