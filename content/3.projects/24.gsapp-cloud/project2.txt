GSAPP Cloud was established at Columbia University in 2011 by Mark Wigley to operate as an internal studio working with the dean, faculty, students and staff of the school to develop infrastructural and experimental forms of online communication. The group worked to define its role through actively developing new tools, prototypes and services to facilitate GSAPP as a laboratory for architectural education. Projects included re-skinning the GSAPP website and homepage, creating an events platform, publications archive, and many other ad-hoc technology projects.
