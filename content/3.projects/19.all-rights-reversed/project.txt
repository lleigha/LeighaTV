A short assignment aimed to provoke and question the definitions of copyright in architecture. Photographs of scaled physical models were made to replicate well known architectural images. In doing so, students produce a copy 3-times removed: the original work, a photograph of the original, a model of the photograph, a photograph of the model. At the University of Michigan's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Undergraduate Studio, Winter 2014.
