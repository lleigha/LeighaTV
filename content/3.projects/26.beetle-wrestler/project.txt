An apparatus that enables humans to wrestle the strongest animal in the world: the rhinoceros beetle. A custom helmet equipped with a camera and display is rigged with motors and switches to scale the forces of each opponent, granting similar manipulative capacities and an even playing field; an architecture of reciprocity.
