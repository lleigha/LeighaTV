<em>Building Megalopolis</em>, as one project of the Extreme Cities initiative, was a 4 week workshop and exhibition located at Columbia University GSAPPâ€™s Studio-X New York from May 1-30, 2013. The project was a collaborative endeavor including Mark Wigley, <a target="_blank" href="http://c-lab.columbia.edu/">C-Lab</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkarchitecturelab.org/work/building-megalopolis/">The Network Architecture Lab</a>, David King, Architecture Online Lab, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neildonnelly.net/#building-megalopolis">Neil Donnelly</a>, Studio-X, and a host of students.

The Network Architecture Lab, which included an Advanced Graduate Studio, researched the BOSWASH Megalopolis 50 years into the past in order to project possible scenarios 50 years into the future.

The Architecture Online Lab designed and built an interactive research tool, which organized content along a horizontally scrolling timeline with a variety of filtering options. The timeline was built as an opensource project with aspirations to be used by other research projects at GSAPP.
